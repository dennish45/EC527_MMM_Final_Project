# EC527_MMM_Final_Project
Optimizing MMM with scalar and vector techniques alongside multithreading. Final project for EC527

### Done
- Basic shell script
- Base serial code
- Base GPU code

### To do
- Slideshow
- Vectorization
- Multithreading (OMP or PThreads)
- More shell automation (block size, register blocks, GPU grid/block sizes)
- Graphs

### Future
- Paper/analysis
- Testing different loop orders (ijk vs kij vs jki)
- Test performance with large matrices (>1024x1024)
- Loop unrolling and multiple accumulators
- AVX (256 and 512-bit registers)

### Extra
- Other MMM algorithms (Canon's algorithm, etc.)
- Trying ATLAS
- Compare professional MMM libraries (CPU vs GPU)
